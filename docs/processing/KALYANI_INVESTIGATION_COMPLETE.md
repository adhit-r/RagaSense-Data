### ‚úÖ CORRECTED DATA

**Kalyani Raga (ID: 2):**
- **Previous (Incorrect)**: 6,244 songs
- **Corrected**: 2,909 songs
- **Source**: Ramanarunachalam decoded data

**Kalyani Variants:**
- **Poorvikalyani (ID: 18)**: 3,436 ‚Üí 1,637 songs
- **Yamunakalyani (ID: 41)**: 2,070 ‚Üí 962 songs

- **Mohanakalyani (ID: 76)**: 730 ‚Üí 279 songs

### üîç Root Cause Analysis

The 6,244 song count was the result of **corrupted data processing** during the initial Ramanarunachalam ingestion:

1. **Duplicate Entries**: 6,243 out of 6,244 entries were duplicates
2. **Unknown Titles**: All entries had "Unknown" song titles
3. **Empty Composers**: All composer fields were empty
4. **Data Structure Issues**: The complex numeric ID system was not properly decoded

### üìä Ramanarunachalam Repository Statistics

After proper decoding of the source code:
- **Total Ragas**: 866 unique ragas
- **Total Concerts**: 14,122 YouTube videos
- **Total Songs**: 105,339 songs
- **Average Songs per Raga**: 121.6

**Top 10 Ragas by Song Count:**
1. Raga 1: 5,090 songs
2. **Kalyani (ID: 2)**: 2,909 songs ‚úÖ
3. Raga 3: 2,797 songs
4. Raga 5: 2,353 songs
5. Raga 4: 2,059 songs

## Technical Resolution

### Data Decoding Process
1. **Analyzed** `raga.json` - Letter to numeric ID mappings
2. **Processed** `concert.json` - YouTube video to song/raga/composer mappings
3. **Decoded** individual raga files - Actual song data with numeric references
4. **Validated** song counts against concert data

### Files Created
- `scripts/ramanarunachalam_proper_decoder.py` - Complete decoding script
- `data/ramanarunachalam_decoded/decoded_ragas.json` - Decoded raga data
- `data/ramanarunachalam_decoded/analysis_report.json` - Analysis report
- `scripts/update_kalyani_data.py` - Data correction script

### Database Updates
- ‚úÖ Updated `data/unified_ragasense_final/unified_ragas.json`
- ‚úÖ Added analysis metadata to raga entries

  - Song count (number of compositions in this raga)
  - Cross-tradition mappings
  - Sources (where the data came from)

### **Tracks (Compositions):**
- **What they are**: Individual musical compositions/recordings
- **What they DO have**:
  - Artist (who performed it)
  - Raga (what musical scale it uses)
  - Tradition (Carnatic/Hindustani)
  - Audio file reference
  - Dataset source

### **Artists (Performers):**
- **What they are**: Musicians who perform tracks
- **What they DO have**:
  - Name
  - Tradition
  - Total track count
  - Sources
